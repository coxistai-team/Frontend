    content: `# Calculus Derivatives

## Definition
The derivative of a function measures the rate at which the function's value changes with respect to changes in its input. It represents the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at any given point.

## Basic Formula
f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

## Common Derivatives
- d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
- d/dx(sin x) = cos x
- d/dx(cos x) = -sin x
- d/dx(e^x) = e^x

## Chain Rule
For composite functions: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)`,
