      <h2>Subscription Services (Monthly/Yearly)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can cancel your subscription at any time. Your access to the paid
          features will continue until the end of the current billing period.
        </li>
        <li>
          Annual Subscriptions: If you cancel an annual subscription within 14
          days of the initial purchase, you are eligible for a full refund. No
          refunds will be issued for cancellations made after 14 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monthly Subscriptions: Monthly subscription fees are non-refundable.
          When you cancel, you will not be charged for the subsequent months.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pay-As-You-Go / Credit Packs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Credits are deducted from your balance as you use the services.</li>
        <li>
          Unused credits are non-refundable and typically do not expire unless
          otherwise stated at the time of purchase.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>One-Time Service Fees (e.g., Custom Model Training)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you cancel the service request before our team has commenced work,
          you are eligible for a full refund, minus any transaction fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          No refunds are available once work has begun on a custom project, as
          resources will have been allocated.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Service Downtime or Failures</h2>
      <ul>

          If our services are unavailable for an extended period due to internal
          technical failures (not including scheduled maintenance), we may, at
          our discretion, issue a pro-rata refund or service credit for the
          affected period to our active subscribers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Refund Processing</h2>

        <li>
          Refunds processed within 5-7 business days to the original payment
          method.
